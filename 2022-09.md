# Weekly Coding Challenge 2022-09: 3D (Rubiks) Cube with CSS

We will build a (non-functional) 3D Rubiks Cube with CSS that can be rotated in 3d space.

Every student that finished Advanced CSS can finish this challenge.

## Requirements

- Create a 3d cube 
- Each side of the cube has a (solved) rubiks cube background-image (linear gradients)
- The cube can be rotated (use hover and/or surrounding elements as a trigger for that)

## Hints

The `perspective` property defines the distance between the user and the browser.

The `backface-visibility` property defines how the back of elements looks like.

## Demo
