# Weekly Coding Challenge 2022-08: Minimal Tetris Clone with P5.js

We will use p5 to built a Tetris-like clone.

## Requirements

- Single blocks will travel from top to bottom
- The left and right keys are used to move the blocks horizontally
- All blocks have the same size but different colors
- When two blocks with the same color are stacked on top or next to each other the player gets a point
- The `frameRate()` methods of p5 is used to set the speed (level) of the game
- The game gets faster after a specific amount of points are won
  - Level 1 = 0 - 10 Points = Framerate 5
  - Level 2 = 11 - 20 Points = Framerate 6
  - Level 3 = 21 - 30 Points = Framerate 7
  - Level 4 = 31 - xxx Points = Framerate 8
