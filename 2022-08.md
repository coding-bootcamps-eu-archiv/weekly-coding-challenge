# Weekly Coding Challenge 2022-08: Minimal Tetris Clone with P5.js

We will use p5 to built a Tetris-like clone.

Every student that finished the p5 module can solve this Challenge.

## Requirements

- Single blocks will travel from top to bottom
- The left and right keys are used to move the blocks horizontally
- All blocks have the same size but different colors
- When two blocks with the same color are stacked on top or next to each other the player gets a point
- The `frameRate()` methods of p5 is used to set the speed (level) of the game
- The game gets faster after a specific amount of points are won
  - Level 1 = 0 - 10 Points = Framerate 5
  - Level 2 = 11 - 20 Points = Framerate 6
  - Level 3 = 21 - 30 Points = Framerate 7
  - Level 4 = 31 - xxx Points = Framerate 8

## Hints

Use the `frameRate()` method to set the game speed.
```js
function setup() {
  frameRate(5); // 5 frames will be rendered per second
}
```

Use the `keyPressed()` function as an event handler for the game.

```js
function keyPressed(e) {
  const pressedKey = e.code;
  console.log(pressedKey);
}
```

You can also embed the p5 library into a HTML file to use VS Code for this Challenge.

```html
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html>
<head>
  <meta charset="utf-8">
  <meta name="viewport" content="width=device-width">
  <title>P5 in HTML File - yeah!</title>
</head>
<body>
  <main id="canvas"></main>
  <script src="https://unpkg.com/p5"></script>
  <script>
     function setup() {
       createCanvas(200,200);
       background(0);
     }
    
     function draw() {
       fill("red");
       circle(mouseX, mouseY, 20);
     }
  </script>
</body>
</html>
```
